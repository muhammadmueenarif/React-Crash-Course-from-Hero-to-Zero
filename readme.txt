What is react?
JS library for building user interface for web apps. created by fb. Features jsx, virtual dom,  component based 
and one waya data flow. 

JSX: syntax extension for js looks like html. easy to create component and make code clear.  

DOM: Document object model. used to organize and access elements on webpage. it is js object. it has all 
elements of html like p, links, lists, etc., DOM allows js to find, update, add, delete elements without 
reloading page.
Virtual dom: lightweight copy of real dom. all changes first applied to virtual dom and then on actual dom. 
React compare virtual dom with actual dom and check what is changed and changes only updated section not entire page. 
Component based: react based on components. components are reusable pieces of code. components can be
used to create complex UI. components can be reused in different parts of app. components are buttons navbar etc., 

One way Data Flow: Data flow only from parent to child. Child can't change data directly. they request to parent 
to change data by events.
